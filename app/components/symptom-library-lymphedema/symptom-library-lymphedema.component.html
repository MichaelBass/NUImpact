                    <p class="detail-pera">When lymph nodes and vessels are removed and/or damaged, the lymph fluid backs up and causes swelling in the affected area. This is called lymphedema. The most common cause of lymphedema is the removal and/or damage to lymph nodes and lymph vessels from cancer treatment. Tumors that damage lymph nodes and vessels can also cause lymphedema. If it's caught early, the lymphedema can be managed.</p>
