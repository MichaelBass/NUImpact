                    <p class="detail-pera pt-pb">Integrative medicine combines complementary therapies, such as acupuncture and massage, with standard cancer therapies to help manage cancer-related side effects and improve well-being.</p>
                    <p class="detail-pera pt-pb">Many people diagnosed with cancer explore complementary therapies to support their health during and after cancer treatment. While many integrative therapies can be beneficial, there's also the potential risk of interactions with cancer treatment and adverse effects. To ensure you have the best results without any risk, it's important to keep your healthcare team informed about any complementary therapies you're using. If you or your team has questions about what options might be most helpful, a consultation with a medical doctor with advanced training in Integrative Medicine can support your goals.</p>
