                    <p class="detail-pera">Palliative care aims to provide relief from pain and discomfortâ€”whether physical, emotional, or spiritual. The goal of palliative care is to enhance your quality of life as you manage cancer. Palliative care teams include physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and social workers.</p>
                    <p class="detail-pera">When people hear the term palliative care, many assume palliative care is the same as hospice. Although palliative care is also frequently involved in care at the end of life, it begins at any stage to help you live as well as possible with cancer. Palliative care is appropriate from the time a patient receives a diagnosis and can be delivered alongside treatments that are meant to cure or manage cancer (e.g., chemotherapy and radiation). The goals of palliative care are to manage symptoms like pain, fatigue, and anxiety and to help you cope with day-to-day challenges.</p>
