                    <p class="detail-pera pt-pb">Due to certain cancer medications and chemotherapy, many cancer patients experience weight gain. Below are tips for dealing with weight gain.</p>
                    <ul class="left-side mt-20">
                        <li>Mention any weight gain to your doctor and work with your healthcare team to manage any weight concerns. They can guide your efforts so you maintain your muscle, while losing body fat.</li> 
                        <li>Record the foods you eat and the calories in those foods. This way, you can see your current caloric intake. To lose weight, you would decrease these calories by about 500 per day.</li>
                        <li>Eat mostly plant-based foods, including vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans. These foods are high in nutritional value and low in calories and fat.</li>
                        <li>Choose no-calorie beverages, such as water, for most of your drinks, unless your doctor or dietitian has advised otherwise.</li>
                        <li>Make sure that your portion sizes are appropriate. If your activity level has dropped, try eating smaller portions to see if your hunger is satisfied with less.</li>
                        <li>Address fatigue, depression, stress, and boredom in ways that donâ€™t involve eating. Sleep or rest rather than eating when tired.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="detail-pera pt-pb">You should not rely on dietary supplements for weight loss due to the potential interaction with treatment and medications. Speak with your doctor about any supplements you're taking or considering taking.</p>
