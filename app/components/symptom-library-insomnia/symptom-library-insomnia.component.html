                    <p class="detail-pera">Here is a list of strategies to try at home to improve your sleep:</p>
                    <ul class="left-side">
                        <li>Go to sleep and wake up at the same time each day, even on the weekends. Your body will get used to the routine.</li>
                        <li>Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and away from distractions like pets and snoring individuals.</li>
                        <li>Use the bedroom for sleep and sexual activity. All other activities (reading, watching TV, eating, talking, using the computer or smartphone, etc.) should be done in another room.</li>
                        <li>Create a relaxing bedtime routine such as taking a bath, drinking a cup of herbal tea, or listening to relaxing music. Having the same relaxing routine each night will help your body wind down before bed.</li>
                        <li>Try not to look at the clock to see the time when youâ€™re having trouble falling asleep at the start of the night or when you wake up during the night.</li>
                        <li>Increase your physical activity during the day.</li>
                        <li>Naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night. If you really need a nap, keep it short (less than 30 minutes).</li>
                        <li>Avoid spicy and heavy meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime.</li>
                        <li>Take melatonin, which is an over-the-counter medication that may help you sleep better at night.</li>
                        <li><b>Relax.</b> Let your <a href='https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/feelings/relaxation' target="_blank">body and mind relax</a> for 20 to 30 minutes each day. Relaxation helps the body and mind react to stress. It also may help you fall asleep more easily. Meditation is a helpful form of relaxation and can improve your stress level.</li>

                    <p class="detail-pera">If you're not sleeping well, talk with your doctor. They may prescribe you medication or recommend a type of therapy that may improve your sleep.</p>
                    <p class="semibold-text pt-pb">Below are some strategies that your doctor may recommend </p>
                    <ul class="left-side">
                        <li>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia, or CBT-I.

                        <li>Your doctor might recommend a prescription medicine to help you sleep better. Sleep medicines may be used for a short time. Make sure to only use sleep medicines that are prescribed or recommended by your doctor.</li>
