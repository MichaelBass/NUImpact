                    <ul class="left-side">
                        <li>Protect your skin from the sun! Use sunscreen of at least 15 SPF every two hours or every hour if you go swimming or are sweating. Also, wear loose clothing that protects your skin from the sun.</li> 
                        <li>Limit how frequently you shave. You may want to use an electric razor or stop shaving if your skin is sore.</li> 
                        <li>Don't use ice packs, heating pads, or bandages on the area that received radiation therapy. Also, radiation therapy can cause your skin to peel or become painful. Make sure to keep the areas that are targeted by the radiation therapy clean and dry so it doesn't become infected.</li> 
                        <li>Use lotions or creams recommended by your health care team to prevent your skin from becoming dry and/or itchy.</li> 
                        <li>Keep your home cool and humid.</li> 
                        <li>Frequently change your bandages to ensure your wounds don't become infected.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="semibold-text pt-pb">How Your Care Team can Help</p>

                    <p class="detail-pera">If self-care strategies don't help, your health care team can prescribe you special dressings, antibiotics, creams, and/or medicine you can take to address your dry, itchy/blistery, or painful skin. They may also refer you to a dermatologist to help you address your skin concerns.</p>
