                    </ul>   
                    <p class="semibold-text">Common triggers of anxiety may include:</p>

                    <p class="detail-pera"><i>An important thing to remember is that some medical conditions and medicines can feel like anxiety.

                    <p class="semibold-text">Self-Care Strategies </p>
                    <p>Listed below are ways to address anxiety through strategies you can try at home:</p>
                    <ul class="left-side">
                        <li>Talk about your feelings and fears with someone you trust. Remember, it’s ok and normal to feel anxious.</li> 
                        <li>Consider joining a support group. It may help to share your feelings and concerns with others who understand what you're going through.</li> 
                        <li>Avoid caffeine, such as coffee, tea, and energy drinks. Caffeine can make anxiety worse.</li>
                        <li>Try to limit alcohol. Alcohol may help you temporarily relax but it can reduce sleep quality which can make anxiety worse.</li> 
                        <li>Use meditation, prayer, or other types of spiritual support.</li>
                        <li>Try relaxation exercises such as meditation and deep breathing. For example, yoga uses breathing and posture exercises to promote relaxation.</li>
                        <li>Being physically active can help with anxiety. Going for a 20-30 min walk is a great self-care strategy.</li> 
                        <li>Guided imagery. This technique uses your imagination to direct the mind’s attention on a peaceful scene that generates a sense of calm and safety.</li>
                        <li>Hypnosis may be useful for guided relaxation, intense concentration, and focused attention as a means to relax.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="semibold-text">How Your Care Team can Help</p>  
                    <p>If you're feeling anxious, talk with your doctor. Ask your doctor for a referral to see a licensed mental health care provider. There are many effective talk therapy treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy that have been shown to reduce anxiety.</p>
                    <p>Your doctor may also discuss the option of taking a  prescription medication to help with how you are feeling. Moderate to severe anxiety may require medication. Conversation with you and your health care providers can determine if medication is right for you. Benzodiazepines are a commonly prescribed type of medication that can reduce anxiety.</p>
