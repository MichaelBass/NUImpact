                    <p class="detail-pera">Nausea is when you feel sick or uncomfortable in the stomach that may be combined with an urge to vomit. Sometimes, you can vomit even if you haven't experienced nausea or eaten recently. You may experience more saliva in your mouth or increased sweating when nauseous or prior to vomiting.</p>
                    <p class="detail-pera">Many types of chemotherapy may cause mild to severe nausea and vomiting. Radiation therapy, especially to the brain, spinal cord, abdomen, and pelvis, may also cause nausea and vomiting.</p>
                    <p class="detail-pera">While mild nausea and vomiting is uncomfortable, it usually doesn't cause serious problems. Vomiting a lot and often is a problem, however, because it can cause problems such as dehydration, and weight loss.</p>

                    <ul class="left-side">
                        <li>Don’t lie down right after you eat. Stay upright. If you're vomiting, sit upright or lie on your side.</li>
                        <li>When you feel sick to your stomach, breathe deeply and try to distract yourself with TV or music.</li>
                        <li>Try to stay hydrated if you’re vomiting. This can be hard, as you may not feel like drinking fluids. It may help to:</li>
                        <ul class="left-side">
                        <li>Sip fluids slowly and in small amounts throughout the entire day</li>
                        <li>Suck on small bites of popsicles or ice chips</li>
                        <li>Drink in-between meals, instead of with meals</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Pay attention to what you eat, and take note of foods that increase nausea so you can avoid them.</li> 
                        <li>Eat 4-5 small meals a day instead of a 3 large meals.</li>
                        <li>Eat and drink slowly and chew your food well.</li>
                        <li>Try eating your food cold or at room temperature, which can decrease strong smells/tastes.</li>
                        <li>Ask others to prepare meals, if the smells make you nauseous.</li>
                        <li>Don't force yourself to eat foods when nauseated.</li>
                        <li>Suck on sugar-free hard candy, like mints. Sugar-free candies containing ginger may also help.</li>
                        <li>Eat foods that are gentle on your stomach, including bland, easy-to-digest foods.</li>
