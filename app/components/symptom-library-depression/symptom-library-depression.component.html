                    <p class="detail-pera">If you are feeling depressed, mention this to your doctor. Remember, getting the help you need is important for your health. Getting treatment for depression can also improve your daily activities, make you more productive at work, and improve the time you spend with your family and friends. Treatment will also help foster more positive thinking that will eventually replace negative thoughts as you continue to improve. Antidepressant medications work by increasing the amount of chemicals in the brain that regulate mood. The primary chemicals in the brain that regulate mood are serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.  There are several types of antidepressant medications that are effective in treating depression occurring along with cancer. Antidepressants generally take between 2-4 weeks to begin relieving symptoms of depression.</p>
